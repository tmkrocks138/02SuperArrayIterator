# 02SuperArrayIterator

Instructions from the Website

1. We will first need to create an iterator class that implements Iterator<String>. We will call this class SuperArrayIterator. 

The superArrayIterator needs to know:
-Which SuperArray is it looking at
-Which element is it up to

It needs to have: 
-A constructor to initialize the state of the iterator. 
-Iterator interface methods ( hasNext, next, and remove. See the iterator<T> documentation for more information.) 
-The remove should be unsupported. 

To start, write this as a separate class, we can discuss inner classes after you get it to work.

2. Now work on your SuperArray!
-Make your SuperArray implement Iterable<String>
-Add the iterator() method.  //SORRY! fixed the typo

3. That is all!
